, I-E
I I-E
am I-E
not I-E
too I-E
worried I-E
about I-E

below I-E

An B-C
EPS I-C
of I-C
$ I-C

would _
mean _
that _
the B-E
company I-E
grows I-E

Given B-C
the I-C
conservative I-C
payout I-C
ratio I-C
there I-C
is I-C
clearly I-C
enough I-C
money I-C
to I-C
invest I-C
in I-C
profitable I-C
projects I-C
so I-C
the I-C
natural I-C
way I-C
to I-C
reward I-C
shareholders I-C
would I-C
be I-C
to I-C
offer I-C
decent I-C

on I-C
the I-C

therefore _
see _
no _

reason _

My B-E
prediction I-E
is I-E
therefore I-E
that I-E
